    <h1>Web is cool</h1>
    <!--
        Instead of searching the web for a beautiful image,
        I drawn one myself.

    <p>
        Web is cool, because it provides useful informations and
        connecting the world.
    </p>
    <p>A web page is commonly consists of three main parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML - HyperText Markup Language</li>
        <li>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <li>JAVASCRIPT - Born for web, lived everywhere</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        With those technologies I build this web page. Thanks to 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">
            MDN
        </a>
        it's not that hard.
    </p>
    <p>By coding this web page, I learned several things about web, here are some:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>web pages using hyperlink to connect each other</li>
        <li>resources are linkable using an URL</li>
        <li>different content using different tag, for semantic</li>
        <li>html is for content, css is for styling, js is for behavior</li>
        <li>and many more...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Web techs used in this page are very basic, no framework and library.
        I know there are many things to learn to build a serious website.
        We dont always need to be serious, have fun is important.

    <p>At last, quote a sentence from Confucius for myself:
        <q>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</q>
    </p>
    <p lang="zh-CN">子曰：<q>譬如为山，未成一篑，止，吾止也。譬如平地，虽覆一篑，进，吾往也。</q></p>
